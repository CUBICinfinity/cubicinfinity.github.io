Jim, Please comment each time you resubmit. This helps me know what state your file currently is in and what modifications I should be looking for. Thanks in advance. Your file speaks well about the variance, normality, and independence of the errors. However, you claim that linearity is violated. I would argue, as you stated in class today, that there is no real concern about linearity due to the small sample size. Further, the red line seems erratic and the dots don't hold very well to the pattern shown by the red line. Linearity seems fine along with everything else. All the same, I am going to award you full credit for this one. Make the change for your own records, but I don't need to see it again. Keep up the great work. Brother Saunders
