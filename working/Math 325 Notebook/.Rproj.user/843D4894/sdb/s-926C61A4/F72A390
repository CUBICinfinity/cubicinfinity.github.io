The activity I haven't done is watch a movie. I don't watch movies very often like the average college student does on their spare time. My question is, \"How long would it take for me to catch up and watch all of the PG and PG-13 movies?\"  The factors to consider is time and rating. The data collected is only for PG and PG-13 movies that have the shortest and the longest amount of time.The first 5 are provided in the table below. There are 1531 observations total in the dataset. \n\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nknitr::kable(head(movies4,5))\n```\n\n\n####Analysis\n\nThe following histogram will show the distribution of PG-PG 13 Movies within a length of time. \n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nhist(movies4$length, xlab = \"Length of Movies\", main = \"PG and PG-13 Movies\", col=\"red\")\n```\n\n\nThis plot describes a big percentage of the PG and PG-13 movies being 100 minutes long. This means that the majority of the movies I watch will be between 100 to 120 minutes long. In total, I have to watch 156703 minuThe table below describes the summary of plot. \n\n\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\n#knitr::kable(head(summary(movies4$length, 5)))\nknitr::kable(favstats(movies4$length))\n```\n\n\n####Interpretation\nAccording to the data given, it looks like I have a lot of catching up to do. In total, I have to watch 156703 minutes of PG and PG-13 movies. That is 15.5 movies a week. I guess I have to get my popcorn ready because I am going to need it. \nIn conclusion, the data shows that I need to get out more and \n",
