This usually is dependent on what audience of viewers they are trying to appeal to. But when a movie is looking for a specific rating and achieves it are there other aspects of filming that are affected? In particular, do films of different ratings tend to have different budgets?\n\nA collection of data was taken from IMdb. for more information on this go to the following link: [Movie Dataset Information](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/ggplot2/movies.html)\n\n###Analysis\n\nTo answer the question of budget differences between film ratings I eliminated all movie entries that did not have a rating and/or a budget. I then used the remaining 1,813 entires to compile a five number summary from each rating.\n\n``` {r, echo=FALSE}\nmpaaBudget$budget <- as.numeric(as.character(mpaaBudget$budget))\nplot(budget ~ mpaa, data=budgetfilms, ylab=\"Budget\", xlab=\"MPAA Rating\", main=\"Budget of MPAA rated films\", col=\"darkcyan\", pch=15)\n```\n",
