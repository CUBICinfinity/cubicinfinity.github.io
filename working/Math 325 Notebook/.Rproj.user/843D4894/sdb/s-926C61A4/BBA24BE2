In May of 1966 a study addressing this question was published in the British Journal of Psychology by the author Cyril Burt. Although the conclusions of the study were fascinating, evidence came to light after Burt's death that suggested the data was falsified. The abstract of [the original article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1966.tb01014.x/abstract) read as follows,\n\n\"In the course of a series of investigations into various aspects of mental inheritance an intensive study has been made of so-called identical twins. The cases examined...those separated in early infancy, and brought up apart... Despite wide differences in environmental conditions, the correlations for intelligence, unlike those for school attainments, prove to be surprisingly high. It is argued that this implies that intelligence, when adequately assessed, is largely dependent on genetic constitution...\"\n\nThe data set Burt shows the IQ score of sets of twins. One twin is raised in a foster home and the other was raised by their biological parents. This raises the question as to whether those environments make a difference in the child's intelligence. For this anallysis, I will be asking whether being brought up with foster parents or biological parents makes a difference in the twins' intelligence. To do this, I will be running a paired t-test from the Burt data. \n\n#### Hypotheses and Analysis \n\nThe test that I will be using is the paired samples t-test since twins are being used in the data set. The null and alternative hypothesis are shown below. \n\n$$ H_O: \\mu_d = 0 $$ \n$$ H_a: \\mu_d \\neq 0 $$ \n\nThe significance level for the test is also shown below. The significance level is vital to running a paired sample t-test because it helps us to determine whether or not to reject the null. If the P-value found is less than this significance level then we reject the null hypothesis. \n\n$$ \\alpha = 0.05 $$ \n\n#### Graphics \n\nThe graphic below displays a qq plot of the data, comparing the IQ of the twins raised by their biological parents and the IQ of the twins raised in foster care. The graph is showing the difference in the data between the sets of twins. If all the points are on the solid line then there would be no difference in the data. Points on the outside of the dotted line would mean that there are some significant differences. \n\n```{r, echo=FALSE} \nqqPlot(Burt$IQbio-Burt$IQfoster, ylab= \"differences\") \n``` \n\nThe stripchart below shows the differences in the data between the IQ of the twins raised by their biological parents and the ones raised in foster care. The closer and the greater the points are to zero, the less difference there is in the data. \n\n```{r, echo=FALSE} \nstripchart(Burt$IQbio-Burt$IQfoster, method=\"stack\") \n``` \n\nThe table below displays the results from the paired samples t-test. \n```{r, echo=FALSE} \npander(t.test(Burt$IQbio, Burt$IQfoster, paired=TRUE, mu=0, alternative=\"two.sided\", conf.level=0.95)) \n``` \n\n#### Interpretation \n\nIn the beginning of the analysis, it was stated that our null hypothesis was that there would be no difference in the data, or that the intelligence is similar among identical twins that are raised apart, whether that be in foster care or biological parents. The alternative was that there would be no similarities between the two. From the qq plot, it is obvious that there are no extreme outliers outside of the dotted lines and most of the points fall on or very near the solid line. Moving onto the stripchart, a majority of the points fall near zero, meaning that there is no difference in the data or very little. Our findings in the graphics are solidified with the results from the paired samples t-test. The P-value is 0.902, which is more than our significance level of 0.05, which means that we must fail to reject the null. In short, there is significant evidence that leads us to reject the null, which means that the intelligence is similar among identical twins that are raised apart. ",
