The fundamental idea is to describe the center, or most *probable* values of the data, as well as the spread, or the *possible* values of the data.\n\n\n<hr />\n\n### Mean {#mean}\n\n<table width=90%>\n<tr><td with=10%>\n$$\n  \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}\n$$\n</td>\n<td width=80% >\n**Measure of Center | 1 Quantitative Variable**\n\nThe \"balance point\" or \"center of mass\" of quantitative data. It is calculated by taking the numerical sum of the values divided by the number of values. Typically used in tandem with the standard deviation. Most appropriate for describing the most typical values for relatively normally distributed data. Influenced by outliers, so it is not appropriate for describing strongly skewed data.\n\n | [R Instructions](../R Code/RNumericalSummaries.html#mean) | [Explanation](./Numerical Summaries/Mean.html) |\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<br />\n<hr />\n\n### Median {#median}\n\n<table width=90%>\n<tr><td with=10% align=center>\n$$\n  \\frac{x_{(n/2)}+x_{(n/2+1)}}{2}\n$$\n$\\uparrow$ **even** $n$ **odd** $\\downarrow$\n$$\n  x_{((n+1)/2)}\n$$\n</td>\n<td width=80% >\n**Measure of Center | 1 Quantitative Variable**\n\nThe \"middle data point,\" i.e., the 50$^{th}$ percentile. Half of the data is below the median and half is above the median. Typically used in tandem with the five-number summary to describe skewed data because it is not heavily influenced by outliers, i.e., it is *robust*. Can also be used with normally distributed data, but the mean and standard deviation are more useful measures in such cases.\n\n | [R Instructions](../R Code/RNumericalSummaries.html#median) | [Explanation](./Numerical Summaries/Median.html) | \n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<br />\n<hr />\n\n\n### Mode {#mode}\n\n<table width=90%>\n<tr><td with=10% align=center>\n**Most**\n\n**Frequent**\n\n**Value**\n</td>\n<td width=80% >\n**Measure of Center / 1 Quantitative or Qualitative Variable**\n\nThe most commonly occurring value.

One of the numerical summaries in the five-number summary. Typically not useful on its own. Gives a good feel for the spread in the left tail of the distribution when used with the five-number summary.\n\n | [R Instructions](../R Code/RNumericalSummaries.html#min) | \n \n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<br />\n<hr />\n\n\n### Maximum {#max}\n\n<table width=90%>\n<tr><td with=10% align=center>\n$$\n  x_{(n)}\n$$\n</td>\n<td width=80% >\n**Measure of Spread | 1 Quantitative Variable**\n\nThe largest occurring data value. One of the numerical summaries in the five-number summary. Typically not useful on its own. Gives a good feel for the spread in the right tail of the distribution when used in the five-number summary.\n\n | [R Instructions](../R Code/RNumericalSummaries.html#max) | \n \n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<br />\n<hr />\n\n\n### Quartiles (five-number summary) {#quartiles}\n\n<table width=90%>\n<tr><td with=10% align=center>\n  **25**$^{th}$, **50**$^{th}$, **75**$^{th}$\n  \n  *and* **100**$^{th}$\n  \n  ***Percentiles***\n\n</td>\n<td width=80% >\n**Measure of Center & Spread | 1 Quantitative Variable**\n\nGood for describing the spread of data, typically for skewed distributions. There are four quartiles. They make up the ***five-number summary*** when combined with the minimum. The second quartile is the median (50$^{th}$ percentile) and the fourth quartile is the maximum (100$^{th}$ percentile). The first quartile ($Q_1$ or lower quartile) and third quartile ($Q_3$ or upper quartile) show the spread of the \"middle 50%\" of the data, which is often called the ***interquartile range***. Comparing the interquartile range to the minimum and maximum shows how the possible values spread out around the more probable values.\n\n | [R Instructions](../R Code/RNumericalSummaries.html#quartiles) |\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<br />\n<hr />\n\n\n### Standard Deviation {#standarddeviation}\n\n<table width=90%>\n<tr><td with=10% align=center>\n$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$\n</td>\n<td width=80% >\n**Measure of Spread | 1 Quantitative Variable**\n\nMeasures how spread out the data are from the mean. It is never negative and typically not zero. Larger values mean the data is highly variable. Smaller values mean the data is consistent and not as variable. It is typically used with the mean to describe the spread of relatively normally distributed data. The order of operations in the formula is important and for this reason it is sometimes called the \"root mean squared error,\" though the calculations are performed in reverse of that. (Study the formula on the left to understand.) The denominator $n-1$ is called the ***degrees of freedom***.\n\n | [R Instructions](../R Code/RNumericalSummaries.html#standarddeviation) | [Explanation](./Numerical Summaries/StandardDeviation.html) | \n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<br />\n<hr />\n\n\n### Variance {#variance}\n\n<table width=90%>\n<tr><td with=10% align=center>\n$s^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$\n</td>\n<td width=80% >\n**Measure of Spread | 1 Quantitative Variable**\n\nGreat theoretical properties, but seldom used when describing data. Difficult to interpret in context of data because it is in squared units. The standard deviation is typically used instead because it is in the original units and is thus easier to interpret.\n\n | [R Instructions](../R Code/RNumericalSummaries.html#variance) |\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<br />\n<hr />\n\n\n### Range {#range}\n\n<table width=90%>\n<tr><td with=10% align=center>\n**max** $-$ **min**\n$x_{(n)}-x_{(1)}$\n</td>\n<td width=80% >\n**Measure of Spread | 1 Quantitative Variable**\n\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum values. A general rule of thumb is that the range divided by four is roughly the standard deviation. Quick to obtain, but not as good as using the standard deviation. Was used more frequently before the advent of modern calculators.\n\n | [R Instructions](../R Code/RNumericalSummaries.html#range) |\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<br />\n<hr />\n\n\n### Percentile {#percentile}\n\n<table width=90%>\n<tr><td with=10% align=center>\n$\\leftarrow$**To the Left**\n</td>\n<td width=80% >\n**Measure of Location | 1 Quantitative Variable**\n\nThe percent of data that is equal to or less than a given data point. Useful for describing the relative position of a data point within a data set. If the percentile is close to 100, then the observation is one of the largest. If it is close to zero, then the observation is one of the smallest. \n\n | [R Instructions](../R Code/RNumericalSummaries.html#percentile) | \n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<br />\n<hr />\n\n\n### Proportion {#proportion}\n\n<table width=90%>\n<tr><td with=10% align=center>\n$\\hat{p}=\\frac{x}{n}$\n</td>\n<td width=80% >\n**Measure of Center | 1 Qualitative Variable**\n\nThe percent of observations in the data that satisfy some requirement. Obtained by dividing the number of *successes* $x$ by the number of total observations $n$. Often referred to as a percentage.\n\n | [R Instructions](../R Code/RNumericalSummaries.html#proportion) |\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<br />\n<hr />\n\n\n### Correlation {#correlation}\n\n<table width=90%>\n<tr><td with=10% align=center>\n$r = \\frac{\\textstyle\\sum\\left(\\frac{x-\\bar{x}}{s_x}\\right)\\left(\\frac{y-\\bar{y}}{s_y}\\right)}{n-1}$\n</td>\n<td width=80% >\n**Measure of Association | 2 Quantitative Variables**\n\nDescribes the strength and direction of the association between two quantitative variables. Restricted to values between -1 and 1. A value of zero denotes no association between the two variables. A value of 1 or -1 implies a perfect positive or perfect negative association, respectively. \n\n | [R Instructions](../R Code/RNumericalSummaries.html#correlation) | \n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<br />\n<hr />\n\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />",
